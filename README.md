# Task-1supervisedML
 Supervised machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence where a model is trained on labeled data, which means the input data includes both the features and the corresponding correct output (labels). The primary goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that the model can predict the label for new, unseen data accurately.
